        This specification is a proposal for building the High Level WoT Architecture model. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
		It identifies the functional components and defines the interface between among those components to effect the desired properties of the overall architecture. 
      </p>
	<p>
	Web of Things provide a standard means of internetworking between WoT resources, running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks. 
	</p>

    <section class='informative'>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media.
	</P>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).

      <dt><dfn title="device" id="dfn-device">device</dfn></dt><dd>
		An apparatus through which a user can perceive and interact with the web. [W3C dig loss]

	</dd>
	 <dt><dfn title="iot" id="dfn-iot">Internet of things (IoT)</dfn></dt><dd>
		A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies.  [ITU-T Y.2060]
	 </dd>
	 <dt><dfn title="resource" id="dfn-resource">resource</dfn></dt><dd>
	 The term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be identified by a URI. [IETF RFC 3986]

	 <dt><dfn title="server" id="dfn-server">server</dfn></dt><dd>
	The role adopted by an application when it is supplying resources or resource manifestations. [W3C WACterms]

	 <dt><dfn title="WWW" id="dfn-WWW">World Wide Web</dfn></dt><dd>
	An information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). [b-W3C web arch]
	</dd>
	 <dt><dfn title="thing" id="dfn-thing">thing</dfn></dt><dd>

	<h2>Execution model of WoT Application</h2>
      <p>
       This is a running model of WoT gateway.

	<h2>Simple Web of Things Architecture Model</h2>
      <p>
       The following diagram illustrates the Functional Components and Interfaces of WoT
      </p>
	</section>
	
	<section>    	
	<h2>Functional Components and Interfaces definition</h2>
      <p>
       	The Simple WoT consists of mandatory component (a Thing as WoT enabled device) and interfaces exposed by those components. 
      </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>WAFG(WoT Application Framework and Gateway)</code></dt>
      <dd>WAFG is a component resident in the WoT device and is the entry point to the WoT Enabler for all the requests coming from other component. The WoT Gateway exposes WOT-1, WOT-2, WOT-3, WOT-4 and WOT-5 interface.
		</dd>
      <dt><code></code>UA(User Agent) </code></dt>
	  <dd>
		A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content. User agents include web browsers, media players, plug-ins, extension and web applications that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with web content. User Agent is a component resident in the network (outside the device). It has the responsibility for interacting bidirectionally with WoT Device by using WoT-1 interface exposed by the WoT Gateway. 
	  	</dd>
      <dt><code></code>Service Resources</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		Services resources(Cloud, Server, Web Resources) are the one of component resident in the network (outside the device) to provide external resources by using WoT-2 interface.
