            <p>Buildings often have a large variety of components such as Heating, Venting, and Air
               Conditioning (HVAC), lighting systems, and possibly more specialized systems such
               as support for reserving rooms electronically. Very often, these systems are not provided
               by a single supplier, but there still should be a single way how interactions with
               the overall building automation infrastructure are possible.
            </p>
            <p>Possibly, building automation scenarios can have layered services, such for example
               when it comes to temperature sensing. While the basic functionality of the building
               automation system might only include to get information about the current temperature
               in a variety of places, there also might be a "temperature history" service. This
               service might allow more advanced features such as accessing the complete history
               of temperature measurements, and possible even more advanced functionalities such
               as queries int this dataset. Again, such an advanced service should be accessible
               in the same way as the more basic services, so that developers can access all these
               services in a uniform way.

                  </b>Applications may want to get an understanding of what kind of sensors and other capabilities
                  are exposed as part of the building automation system. In such a case, it is necessary
                  that available resources can be described or are describing themselves, preferably
                  using a framework that makes those descriptions uniform even if the underlying sensors
                  or services are using different implementation technologies.

                  it is advantageous for the building automation system to support some kind of push
                  mechanism, so that application can subscribe to these events, and will be notified
                  when they happen. This increases the workload of the building automation system (it
                  has to keep track of subscribers), but may make development of certain classes of
                  applications much easier.

            <p>Manufacturing plants and process automation plants not only have to be monitored on-site

               indicators) of different manufacturing sites and optimization of the production processes

               The open platform enables the connection between data points provided from devices/applications

            <p>An industrial automation systems (IAS) needs to be managed throughout different phases
               of its lifecycle, e.g., development, engineering, operation, maintenance, optimization,
               and other phases. The lifecycle management is a challenging task due to various reasons.
               For instance, it is a task that involves various stakeholders (e.g., domain engineers,
               software engineers, system engineers, system installers etc.) and hence it is an error-prone
               task, it is often handled in a safety critical environment, it needs to be maintained
               over a longer timeframe (during which some of the stakeholders or parts of the system
               may not be available) and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>Let us consider a use case scenario which, throughout the lifecycle management of
               an IAS, considers following tasks: Development of a new automation function, service
               or an app based on available resources and domain knowledge; Support for resource
               discovery, optimal selection and choreography of resources; Parametrization of resources,
               functions, services and apps; Support for adaptive services running in a dynamic environment
               (i.e., physical resources appear and disappear); Monitoring and diagnosis of resources,
               functions, services and apps; Optimization of automation workflows involving different
               resources and different lifecycle phases.
            </p>
            <p>From these activities, as found in a typical lifecycle management of an IAS, one can

            <h2>Resource Description</h2>
            <p>In loosely coupled systems, applications may encounter resources they have no prior
               knowledge about. Resource Description is a facility that allows resources to be described
               or describe themselves, so that applications can use those descriptions to learn about
               certain properties and/or capabilities of a resource. Resource descriptions on the
               highest abstraction level needs to provide two main facilities: identification of
               resources through some referencing mechanism, and description of resources through
               some data model.

               request information form servers. This pattern supports scalability very well, because
               servers do not need to keep track of clients. However, in some scenarios it may be
               advantageous for this interaction pattern to be reversed, with servers (i.e., the
               managing entities of resources) initiating an interaction for certain resource-based
               events. These push interactions require servers to keep track of clients (often referred
               to as "subscribers"), but on the other hand minimizes interactions when resource events
               are infrequent but should be noticed by clients as soon as possible.

            </h2>
            <p>RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate
               data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the
               evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
               RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship
               between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as
               a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data
               to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure
               forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between
               two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible
               mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

                  (i.e., descriptions) of Web resources. This is facilitated by using URIs as identifiers,
                  and by using attribute/value pairs that make statements about those URI-identified
                  resources. RDF descriptions can be of arbitrary complexity by joining triples to form
                  a graph, and they can use and combine various vocabularies so that the graph contains
                  information according to the concepts defined in those vocabularies.

            </h2>
            <p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of
               the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that enables the near-real-time exchange of structured
               yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. This document defines
               XMPP's core protocol methods: setup and teardown of XML streams, channel encryption,
               authentication, error handling, and communication primitives for messaging, network
               availability ("presence"), and request-response interactions.

            </h2>
            <p>EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information
               Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of
               computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information
               and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements,
               for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is
               amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of datatype representations,
               it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams.
